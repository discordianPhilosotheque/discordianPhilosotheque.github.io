            So the other day I had some music flowing in my ears and there was this funny "if you pray for the rain you goat a need to deal with the mud" thing. Kind of a nice way to say that you get the result of what you do. I think its good to always have in your mind that you are the one that will serve you best and that learning to deal with the real world is good and will empower you.
