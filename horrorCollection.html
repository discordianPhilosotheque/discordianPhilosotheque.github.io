            Do you know why Obama is black? I asked him to be. He told me that it was a shit idea. But have you seen him today? He's not black, he's not even president anymore! I mean, if he was black, he would be president don't you think?

            </span>
            I kind of got the curse of greyface about theme. It's like eating 5 icecream in a row. The last one make you sick for a month. But you know what? I got sick of the servants of the funny cats. These peoples always want to talk about cats. Cats are so funny lololol. Well, they can be but you are not so I'm out. Is talking about something that is funny funny? I don't think so. Please laught, I am inconfortable right now.
