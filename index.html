              It follow's the principle that everything must be applied to everything just to see where it leads us. For example, how gamification is applyed to everything even to the creation of itself. That sounded like chain letters and viruses or how religions fail to keep themself secret by copulating to much. But I'm no pope of any religion whatsoever so I can't really say much on that subject. Keep your childrens out of my plane plane plane driveway.

                  Ok, all of this is good shit and whatever but why are my pockets empty right now?
              </span>
              You know, empty like my brain can be some times? I don't know how to tell you this but I have money on my mind and in my pocket but sometimes it feels so empty! Its like a big bowl of icecream that you don't want to eat. Empty for you.

                  But experience is overated.
              </span>
              Rocks don't care about how you feel about a book, so why write an other book? Do you want to confuse rocks but trying to explain to theme that book and books have different meanings? Anyway, all books are the same, the proof : for all possible paire of book formed from the set of all books we can assume that book == book and so they contain the exact same information. I just saved you lots of numbered paper that you would have used on med books.
