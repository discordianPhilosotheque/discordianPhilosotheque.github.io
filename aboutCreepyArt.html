            Its creepy in context. In every context. Thats the funny thing. It's absolute. Think about something creepy in a creepy place. Is it creepy? Yes of cours. Then how about a candy castle in wich you open the door to the toilet and you find death floating with a necklace of hunmans fingers? CREEPY I tell you, I saw it once...
